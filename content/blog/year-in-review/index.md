For most, 2020 has been one of the most challenging years in their life.

That statement would be accurate for me as well.

## Isolation

I experienced long periods of time with high levels of anxiety and uncertainty.

Like most folks, I experienced isolation for 9+ months.

Another shared experience and pain point for many were holidays and birthdays, most of those were spent without loved ones and friends.

## Perspective

Although this year was weird and uncomfortable in many ways, it taught me a lot about the impact and importance that family and friends have in my life.

That might sound _overly cliche_, but I think it was an aspect of my life that I completely took for granted.

Going into 2021 I have a newfound perspective of my life and the things that really matter to me because of 2020.

If you have friends or family that you care about, but you have not heard from them and you miss them. Tell them!

I spent too much of my time focused on what was 6 feet in front of me, and not enough time reaching out to the ones I love.

## Rediscovering old hobbies

I got my first skateboard on my 11th birthday, I can still remember unwrapping it and feeling indescribable joy as I rode down my driveway for the first time on it.

I spent countless weekend days and weekday nights skating around with my friends. As I get older, I realize, maybe this is what they meant by _The Good Ole Days_?

I stopped skating around the age of 17, but I always admired the effort that skateboarders put into their video parts and the culture surrounding it.

This year, I watched the [Vans video "Alright, Ok"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ZzHtww6Tc&t), and I immediately fell back in love with skateboarding.

## Books I enjoyed the most

2020 was the year that [I fell in love with reading](https://www.martincartledge.io/book-list-2021/). For those moments in time, I forgot about the world we live in and focused solely on the new world I was apart of.

My three favorite books of 2020:

- "[The Institute](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43798285-the-institute)" by Stephen King
- "[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)" by James Clear
- "[Beartown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33413128-beartown)" by Fredrik Backman

## Music I enjoyed the most

There were so many good albums that came out this year. Much like reading, music was another medium that allowed me to escape my reality.

My top ten albums of 2020:

## Goals for 2021

Goals can be a tricky thing. You are motivated, you are ready for change. You set your sights on the top of a mountain. The summit can mean a lot of different things for people. Financial independence, career achievements, habit-forming, etc.

For a long time, I felt that I was a failure if I didn't stick to every single goal I made the year prior; however, now I look at it as a win regardless.

If I accomplish every goal I make for myself, great! If I do not, that is okay too!

What matters the most for me is the fact that I am setting aside time to reflect on the things I have done, and the things I want to get better at or achieve in the future.

As long as I work towards achieving these things, that is enough.

Sometimes the most important part is not achieving a goal, but the steps you take to get there.

For 2021 I broke down my goals into two categories: Daily and Yearly.

After reading [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits), I decided to shift my approach to setting new habits. That is why you might think to yourself _reading a single chapter of a book is not much_ or _exercising for five minutes is not that impactful_, and you are right!

The idea of these daily goals is to form a habit that compounds results over time.

I have made these habits seem so easy to avoid missing one day.

Even on my least motivated days, reading a single chapter of a book or writing ten words is doable.

Daily Goals

- Read one chapter of a book
- Write ten words for my blog
- Exercise for five minutes

Goals for the year:

- Lose 20 lbs
- Be completely vegan
- Read 24 books

## In Summary

So, goodbye 2020. You taught me a lot of things but I am ready for a new year.

Here's to a happy, safe, and fulfilling new year!
