I started a podcast, Atomic Jolt!

### What?

> Atomic: a small component (or unit) in a larger system⠀
⠀

> Jolt: an unexpected force that prompts an action, feeling, or change

### Why?

We often underestimate how small experiences affect us.

The conduits of these experiences come in many forms: _movies_, _books_, _games_, _hobbies_, _and more_. 

These small moments of **inspiration**, **enlightenment**, or **happiness** tend to have a ripple effect that follows us throughout our lives.

These experiences are often sparked from a single moment, _a small powerful change_.⠀
⠀
Atomic Jolt discusses these moments from their origin. The stories are unique; however, moments of small powerful change is _something we all share_.
